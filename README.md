# xash

A dungeon-crawler. Test bed for tdgl3 (see elsewhere)

The intention is that while writing Xash I will be getting some cool OpenGL things working and whichever ones
I think are of general enough use will be transferred into tdgl3.  The twin goals are to have an amusing game
that has slightly higher production values than I could squeeze in during PyWeek, and a nice little library I
can release at least a month before the next PyWeek (or the one after) to use for simpler games.
